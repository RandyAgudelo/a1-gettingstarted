    <p> 
      I have worked as a Wetting Research Assistant and BME Lab Assistant. As a Wetting Research Assistant,
      I prepared materials' surfaces for wetting analysis. I have also analyzed a water's droplet's contact angle
      on the material's surface as it expands and recedes. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As a BME Lab Assistant, I have prepared instruments and materials for class, performed inventory 
      checks, restocked lab supplies when necessary, sterilized lab instruments and materials using an autoclave,
      and much more.
